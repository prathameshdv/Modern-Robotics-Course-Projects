PRM Motion Planning with A* – Scene 5

This project implements a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) planner with straight-line local planning and A* graph search.

The program reads obstacles.csv and generates nodes.csv, edges.csv, and path.csv, which are visualized in the CSV Motion Planning Kilobot scene in CoppeliaSim.
